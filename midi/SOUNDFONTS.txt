MIDI soundfonts for Hypseus
===========================

The Hypseus distribution contains the GPL'd 'TimGM6mb.sf2' soundfont by default.

See COPYING.txt - This is a small but complete GM soundfont.


Installing a custom soundfont
=============================

If you own, and have preference for, a different SF2 soundfont:

Rename the .sf2 file to overwrite the 'soundfont.sf2' file in this 'midi' sub-folder.
